title: 'Defining and Communicating "Done"'
ShowToc: false
---

Recently, I created an internal guide for my team after noticing repeated struggles with meeting self-set deadlines. My hope is that sharing our approach might help other teams facing similar challenges.

Below is a simplified framework we've adopted to clearly define what "done" truly means, how to provide accurate estimates, and best practices for transparent communication. Feel free to adapt it to your own team's needs!

## What Does "Done" Mean?

"Done" isn't merely finishing code and merging it. For us, a task is considered complete only when:

- Code is implemented and thoroughly tested (including both front-end and back-end tests when applicable).
- Peer code review is complete, and feedback has been addressed.
- The feature has passed QA (developer or dedicated QA tester).
- Necessary documentation is updated.
- Stakeholders (PM, Designers) confirm the implementation meets expectations.
- All dependencies from other teams are resolved and integrated.
- The feature is deployable and functions correctly in staging or production environments.

In short, **Done = Ready for production, delivering value, without blockers.**

## Providing Realistic Estimates

### Be Honest About Uncertainty

When uncertain about the complexity of a task:

- Don’t give rushed estimates that might be mistaken for commitments.
- Instead, request time explicitly to investigate the task (e.g., "I’ll need approximately 1 day to accurately estimate this.").

### Estimate in Days or Half-Days

Avoid hourly estimates unless the task is very familiar. Tasks typically take longer than anticipated. Use half-days or full days for clarity and realistic buffer.

### High-Level Estimates for Ambiguous Work

Clearly indicate when estimates are broad or directional for large tasks or epics, highlighting the inherent uncertainty.

## Planning for Dependencies and Collaboration

### Account for Cross-Team Availability

Remember to factor in:

- Review timelines; code reviews aren't instant.
- Feedback cycles with stakeholders, designers, or QA.
- Delays from cross-team dependencies.

### Identify Needed Support Early

Consider upfront what you'll require:

- Clarified designs or business logic.
- Dedicated QA resources.
- Access to necessary environments or data.

Raise anticipated blockers early in the planning process to minimize surprises.

## Communication Best Practices

### Proactively Share Changes or Risks

Complex work often takes longer than initially anticipated. This is normal, but silence around missed deadlines is not acceptable.

Always:

- Communicate delays or potential issues as soon as possible.
- Clearly articulate challenges to project managers and teammates.
- Seek help early—don't silently struggle or compromise quality.

Cutting corners (like skipping testing) will lead to more issues down the line.

### Reflect After Delays

When tasks run significantly over:

- Reflect briefly: What caused delays?
- Could planning or stakeholder involvement be improved?

Conducting a quick "mini-retro" after feature completion helps refine the team's future estimates and processes.

## Summary

- Define “done” comprehensively: include testing, review, documentation, and stakeholder approval.
- Provide transparent, realistic estimates based on actual investigation.
- Plan with dependencies, review cycles, and unpredictability in mind.
- Never compromise quality to hit deadlines. Communicate proactively.
- Reflect and adapt continuously to improve future deliveries.
