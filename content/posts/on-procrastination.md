One reason we often procrastinate is our fear of missing out on the countless possibilities life offers. That anxiety can paralyze us—delaying new projects or even causing us to abandon current ones in favor of the next exciting opportunity.

Every decision we make, procrastination included, comes with an inevitable trade-off: by choosing one path, we let countless others slip away. **Loss is inevitable**. In the end, there's little reason to procrastinate. You'll miss things—and that's just part of life.
